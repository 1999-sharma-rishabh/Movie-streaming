# Movie-streaming
Developed a full-stack movie streaming application using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack.
Utilized React for the frontend along with Node.js and Express for the backend API, enabling seamless communication between the frontend and the database.
Implemented Redux Toolkit for state management, ensuring efficient and scalable data handling across the application and used MongoDB to securely store movie data, user information, and authentication details.
Integrated external APIs (e.g., IMDB API) to fetch real-time movie information and trailers, enriching the content.
